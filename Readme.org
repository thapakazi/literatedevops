*** Assumptions

    i love to split my terminal and jump around org files, so do you.
    my tool chain comprise of  [[https://tmux.github.io/][tmux]], [[https://xkcd.com/378/][emacs]], [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] & X where,
    /X=guinea pigs of different taste/ {dbs(redis,mongo,pg),
    langs(ruby,sh,go), confs(*rc, emacs*), random(logs,jsons,list,resume,org,lisp), swag(revealjs,blog)...}


*** Motivation
    
    i was wondering what if, our works be done/logged in some reproducible
    way. So far journey have been to consume more and produce less.
    Consumption is so random, and kindof hardocoded to brain as some
    sumof(context, env vars, github/gist urls, stackoverflow tricks,
    blogs). Bad thing ðŸ˜Ÿ, they disappear with time. So trying this weird
    way of trailing the workflow/learning in plain simple text.
